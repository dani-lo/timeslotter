# timeslotter
A small utility to create timeslots. To view, clone the repository the nrun bower install and npm install, that should be enouch to get it started. Please note, imlementation is basic, styles are not too elaborate as I just coded on the fly and without a design, much of it should be refctored, both in terms of markup / styles and functionality.
