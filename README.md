# timeslotter
A small utility to create timeslots. To view, clone the repository then run bower install and npm install. If you get errors, there migh be a problem with require-js text plugin not being remembered by Bower: in that case you will then need to manually run 'bower install requirejs-text' (I have added it manually to Bower json, so should not happen), that should be enough to get it started. Then from the cli, run 'node run.js'.

Please note, imlementation is basic, styles are not too elaborate as I just coded on the fly and without a design, much of it should be refctored, both in terms of markup / styles and functionality.
I chose to use a Requirejs / Bckbone setup. I also chose to maintain the directory trees for the minified files rather then using r.js to export the app in one file: this can be changed to use r.js.
 I didn't implement any advanced form validation, just basic stuff. Of course this could be extended a lot, I did add methods for validation, just a matter of enhancing their logic in the form class: I did this on purpose as I wanted to focus more on application design / structure, so I coded a more advanced form management OO design rather then focusing on the complexity of the actual validation logic.
